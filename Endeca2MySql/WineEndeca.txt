Viñas del Vero Luces White 2015, Spain, 13% It is aromatic and complex on the nose, evocative of fruits such as apricot, peach, apple and lime - On the palate it gives a sense of being structured and clean tasting with a pleasing finish reminiscent of exotic fruits such as pineapple and mango.

P_History:  The name Free Run comes from the method of using only the first, free-flowing, free run juice to make this wine. We've selected an ancient Celtic symbol representing the cycles and seasons of life to emblazon our bottle as, at this level of Flagstone, we really want wines to represent the climate and our passing interaction with our environment. Each season of Sauvignon is a cycle of nature within the Flagstone brand, capturing the nuances of life, love and friendship.

P_RegionalInformation:  While Sauvignon Blanc can be grown virtually everywhere, there are very few places that can produce a Sauvignon Blanc of stunning quality. This illusive essence is largely determined by where the vines are planted, the soil type, slope, aspect and the meso-climate that influences the vineyard.

State-of-the-art cellar technology and 8 generations of winegrowing and winemaking experience are the guarantee of consistently high quality. Blue Nun has achieved real cult status over decades, and is a guarantee of successful trade partnership.

P_ExpertComment:  If ever there was a wine that was springtime bottled, this is it! It’s fresh, crisp and bursting with green apple and grapefruit flavours. Pecorino’s a cheese! Yes, but it’s also a grape. Both are named after the pecora (Italian for sheep), which, according to local legend, were often found nibbling the vines. This wine is sourced in Terre di Chieti in central Italy. This is where the highest quality Pecorino grapes can be found – as long as the sheep haven’t got there first! Being Italian, it loves its food – fish, chicken even a tasty spring veg frittata. Laura Jewell MW, Tesco Category Product Development Manager

P_Region:  Champagne 
P_RegionalInformation:  Champagne, the very symbol of sophistication, graceful living and celebration, is produced nowhere else in the world. All champagnes are made within a few miles of each other outside Reims and Epernay, near the Abbey of Saint-Pierre where the legendary Benedictine monk, Dom Pérignon, supposedly invented the bubbly by accident in the early 18th Century (some would say by divine inspiration).

P_History:  With vines planted in 1989, Quitralman is a very innovative field, pioneer in the plantation of alternative varieties such as Riesling. A very interesting vineyard is thanks to the more than 1,000 mm of rain per year, and to the fact that the water remains retained within the structure of the soil, so many of the blocks do not need irrigation.

P_Region:  Bio Bio 
P_RegionalInformation:  Quitralman is located in the village of Mulchén, 550km south of Santiago, in the Bio Bio valley. Unique for its hills and terraces, the vineyard is planted in the banks of the Bio Bio river. Red clay soil directly contributes to the minerality of the wines, offering excellent and unique character to this really intense and perfumed Sauvignon Blanc. The southern latitude of the vineyard allows a slower maturity of the grapes, providing a pronounced acidity with fresh and juicy wines with great intensity.

The beginning of the growing season has been characterised by the alternation of dry and rainy periods and it has allowed the perfect development of the vines. The following hot and dry summer led to an abundant harvest with healthy grapes.

P_Region:  The Rhone Valley 
P_RegionalInformation:  The altitude reaches 120m at its highest and it covers 3200 hectares of land with at least three distinct types of soil or terroirs. In the north and north-east the famous galets roulés, round rocks or pebbles covering the clay soil. The rocks are famous for retaining the heat from the plentiful sun, some 2800 hours a year, releasing it at night, ripening the grapes faster than in the eastern part of the appellation, where the soil is mostly sand, as well as to the south where the soil is more gritty

P_History:  Barbera d'Alba is a key DOC of Piedmont, north-western Italy, famed for its tangy, cherry-like red wines made from Barbera grapes. Barbera (like so many Italian wine grape varieties) has ancient origins, although it has only been traceably documented since the 17th century. Barbera-based wines are well regarded for their rustic yet generous character. For a wine to be legally labelled as Barbera d'Alba, it must be made from at least 85% Barbera grapes.

P_TastingNotes:  A winning combination of Tempranillo, Graciano and Mazuelo grapes, this is a modern classic loaded with rich, ripe, black fruit flavours. Think plum and black cherry, together with a sprinkling of cinnamon spice and vanilla from time spent ageing on oak barrels. Really loves roast lamb or beef stews.

P_History:  In 2011 Piccini decided to produce a unique wine that would not only taste Italian, but would feel Italian. Memŏro is now internationally acclaimed for its quality and fantastic value, fast becoming one of the iconic wines of the Piccini family. In 2014, Piccini has launched its first 2010 Vintage Edition Memoro Red. With the same ambition of creating a quality driven Italian blend, the Vintage Edition offers an oak aged version of the same concept: 4 varietals hand selected from 4 different regions.

P_History:  Hawke's Bay's benign climate and high sunshine have long-established the region as ideal for fruit-growing. Vines were first planted in 1851 by Marist missionaries and Hawke's Bay enjoys a significant international reputation for producing some of the country's best wines, red and white. Syrah is an exciting variety showing great distinction, gaining strength as sites and clones are refined. Wines are perfumed, elegant with ripe fruit, supple tannins and lingering spice.

P_Region:  Champagne 
P_RegionalInformation:  The Champagne terroir has two major distinguishing features: northerly latitude and a dual climate that is subject to oceanic and continental influences alike. The subsoil in Champagne is predominantly limestone. This type of subsoil provides good drainage and also imparts that particular mineral flavour found in certain Champagne wines.

P_Region:  Piedmont 
P_RegionalInformation:  The official Asti and Cuneo zone stretches beyond the limits of the Asti province, to both east and west, nudging in the Cuneo and Alessandria provinces respectively, its western limit is the village of Serralunga D'Alba, although few Moscato vines are planted there. The area is quite hilly and the sloping vineyards create many different mesoclimates and exposures.

P_RegionalInformation:  The Adelaide Hills rise from an elevation of 400m and are often at least two degrees cooler in summer than the Barossa Valley. The region also boasts a variety of soil types and misty wet weather during spring that prevents excessive fruit set - reducing yields and increasing fruit intensity.

P_History:  In 1956 a group of pioneering family growers gathered together in the small village of Ville-sur-Arce in the south of Champagne with the aim of producing a range of Champagnes to compete with some of the most respected "Grandes Marques". More than 50 years on and these families have finally realised their dream. 'Lelieur' is a local name given to 'The Craftsman' and this stunning Champagne is a masterclass in blending in the cellar.

P_History:  Port is produced in the sheer terraced vineyards of the Douro River valley, further inland towards the Spanish border from Porto. Temperature range from 35 degrees C in the summer to below 0 in the winter; the rainfall can fall to drought conditions in summer - harsh conditions that lead to excellent concentration of fruit and produces wines of great power. The inaccessibility of the area means the vineyards are still tended and harvested by hand.

P_Region:  Douro 
P_RegionalInformation:  Port is produced in the sheer terraced vineyards of the Douro River valley, further inland towards the Spanish border from Porto. Temperature range from 35 degrees C in the summer to below 0 in the winter; the rainfall can fall to drought conditions in summer - harsh conditions that lead to excellent concentration of fruit and produces wines of great power. The inaccessibility of the area means the vineyards are still tended and harvested by hand.

P_History:  The Stellenbosch winelands are considered to be the capital of the South African wine industry. Simon van der Stel arrived at the Cape as commander in 1679 and soon after was appointed its first governor. Later that year he undertook his first tour of inspection, which brought him to ‘the most charming valley he had ever seen' - the Stellenbosch winelands. He ordered the planting of the oaks, which is why it is sometimes referred to as Eikestad, or ‘town of oaks'

P_RegionalInformation:  The Riverina region enjoys a warm Mediterranean climate with winter dominant rainfall. Sandy loam soils vary in colour and structure from red sandy earths to brown clay loams. The Bilbul winery in the Riverina is the birthplace of icon dessert wine Noble One, developed by Darren De Bortoli in 1982 which since its release has been awarded 117 trophies and 376 Gold medals. Climatic conditions allow the development of 'noble rot' to occur, providing the opportunity to make complex sweet white wines.

The bottle might be small but the flavours are huge: apricot, honey and peach all wrapped in luscious sweetness. Made by De Bortoli, one of Australia's very best producers of sweet wines.

P_Region:  Prosecco 
P_RegionalInformation:  Prosecco is one of the most famous Italian semi-sparkling and sparkling wines. The name refers to an area which beauty is rich in forests and vineyards, together with its cultural and historical heritage and the heroic farming required to cultivate some terraced vineyards on the steepest slopes have justified the local producers' request for the Prosecco D.O.C.G. region to be designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Its founders believed that wine should be more fun and less serious; and created a wine that could be enjoyed by everyone from first-time wine drinkers to hard-core aficionados. Barefoot Wine & Bubbly is the most awarded and #1 wine brand in the US and was introduced to the UK in 2007. Staying true to its grassroots beginnings Barefoot Wine & Bubbly gives back to local non-profit groups through charitable wine donations.

P_Region:  Central Valley 
P_RegionalInformation:  The Valle Central stretches from Maripo Valley to Maule Valley - almost 400km with varying climates. Frontera grapes come from an area with a Mediterranean climate. The Frontera brand celebrates this winemaking paradise which is protected by four natural frontiers which the Frontera wines are named after: glaciers in the South, the Atacama Desert in North, the Andes mountain range in the East and the Pacific ocean in the west. The frontiers protect our lush, sun-drenched vineyards bringing you an authentic taste of Chile in a glass.

P_TastingNotes:  Bright and vivid ruby red in colour, with great intensity - this wine displays delicious hints of black cherry and plum on the nose, which overlays a slight touch of cacoa and pepper all integrating perfectly with the dark fruit flavours.

P_Grape:  Garganega Bianca 
P_HeirarchyCode:  W43AD 
P_History:  The Cantina di Monteforte co-op is situated in the eastern part of Soave Classico and Soave. They have 1,200 hectares in total, part in Soave Classico and part outside the Classico zone, with some of the best vineyards in Soave Classico. Sixty per cent of their vineyards are on the hills, facing south and southeast, which gives wines that are riper and fuller than most others produced in Soave. The co-op has 600 members and harvests about 20,000 tonnes of grapes a year. Cool summer breezes blowing down the Alpone valley from the foothills of the Dolomites to the north give warm days and cool nights, which helps with the accumulation of aromatic characters in the grapes. Matt Thomson works with Gaetano Tobin at the Cantina to produce these wines.

P_History:  The story behind one of Chile's most famous wines began more than 120 years ago. Don Melchor, founder of Concha y Toro, stored batches of his best wines in an underground cellar. When he noticed that bottles had been stolen, he spread a rumour amongst the locals that a devil lived in his cellar. Hence the name of Casillero del Diablo, the devil's cellar. Since 2008, Diablo wines have received more than 80 awards from internationally recognised competitions, including 8 Gold medals and 18 Silver medals.

P_Region:  Andalucia 
P_RegionalInformation:  Jerez Superior is the celebrated land of albariza, a porous, chalky soil characterised by its pale colour that is particularly well suited to the cultivation of vines grown for the production of quality wines. The climate is mild with more than 3,000 hours of sun softened by the cooling influence of the Atlantic. These factors, together with a long winemaking tradition, allow for excellent ripening of the Palomino grapes and ensure a high degree of beaumé (level of sweetness) and moderate acidity.

P_History:  Barón de Ley is a winery founded in 1985 by a small group of Rioja wine professionals and who conceive and start a project of innovative and unique characteristics in this prestigious DOCa. The original Baron de Ley project was based on the idea of developing a purely “vineyard driven” winery, oriented to the production of high quality wines from own vineyards. The other main guideline behind the project was to develop and implement a new style of “modern” Rioja wines

P_TastingNotes:  Chenin Blanc might call the Loire Valley home but it has a long history in South Africa too. Here, top SA winemaker Adi Badenhorst has made an apple fruit-filled gem, with pea, honey and spice notes too. Works a treat with lightly spiced foods, or with a simple roast chicken.

P_TastingNotes:  If you like your reds full-bodied and mellow, you can call off the search. This one is a blend of Tempranillo and Garnacha grapes, made in the Cariñena region in Spain. With rich, dense black cherry fruit and gentle spice, have this ready when you've got roast lamb on the table.

P_History:  The story behind one of Chile's most famous wines began more than 120 years ago. Don Melchor, founder of Concha y Toro, stored batches of his best wines in an underground cellar. When he noticed that bottles had been stolen, he spread a rumour amongst the locals that a devil lived in his cellar. Hence the name of Casillero del Diablo, the devil's cellar. Since 2008, Diablo wines have received more than 80 awards from internationally recognised competitions, including 8 Gold medals and 18 Silver medals.

P_SupplierNumber:  60581 
P_TastingNotes:  This variety disappeared from its place of origin in Médoc, north of Bordeaux, France following the phylloxera outbreak in the 19th century. It reappeared in Chile at the end of the 20th Century. Casillero del Diablo's Carmenere is smooth and delicate with intense colour, smooth, round tannins, and attractive aromas of black currant and chocolate. From the Central Valle, with Riverbench and benchland associated soils, this Carmenere is aged in American oak barrels, giving it a dark and deep purple colour. The aroma is bursting with luscious fruit flavours, ark plums and blackcurrant, black chocolate with hints of coffee and toasted American oak. On the palate, notes of dark plums and spice, generously framed by toasty American oak with a soft and well structured mouthfiling texture. Food Pairing: It expresses marvellously well with game meat, garnished with sweet and-sour sauces and berries, as well as mature cheeses.

P_RegionalInformation:  Bold and intensely flavored, our Ghost Pines Cabernet Sauvignon was crafted with grapes from Sonoma and Napa. The blend of these two regions creates an expansive palate that offers dark fruit flavors, round tannins and an enduring finish. Sweet vanilla nuances and the occasional savory note make this Cabernet a truly unique wine.

P_History:  The name Ara means ‘pathway’ or ‘stepping stone’ in Maori. It is a single estate so all the grapes come from their unique parcel of land in the Wairau Valley. Bordered by rivers on three sides, with the foothills of the Southern Alps to the west, this combination of maritime climate, soils and altitude means their location produces some of the best grapes in the region. Ara belong to Sustainable Winegrowing NZ, an initiative of the New Zealand Wine Growers’ association. By practicing sustainable winegrowing, replanting native species and avoiding treated timber, they are minimising their impact on the environment.

P_Region:  Marlborough 
P_RegionalInformation:  Ara's estate lies at the elevated end of the Wairau Valley in Marlborough, a region which is wedged between mountain ranges and the ocean, near the top of the South Island. Being further from the sea (30km) and at higher altitude (100m), nights are even cooler here than in other parts of the region. This slows down ripening, creating elegant acidity and more intense flavours. The relatively infertile, free-draining soil is very much like that in Graves and Médoc in Bordeaux.

P_TastingNotes:  Wairau, wedged between the mountains and the ocean, enjoys a unique mix of maritime climate, soils and altitude - All the grapes come from a single parcel of land in the Ara vineyard, creating an intense gold-medal winner, rich with apricot and grapefruit flavours.

P_History:  Barefoot Wine & Bubbly got started in California in the 1960s. Its founders believed that wine should be more fun and less serious; and created a wine that could be enjoyed by everyone from first-time wine drinkers to hard-core aficionados.

P_History:  One fine day, as a truck laden with cattle rattled past D.B. Rust's farm, one of the passengers decided The Cow Stops Here. She jumped. Not only did she survive, but she has thrived, and even produced several offspring. Because she embodies the robust spirit of the Swartland, we pay tribute to our noble Nguni* cow, Survivor and her Offspring. *Nguni cattle are the traditional livestock of the Zulu people of South Africa

P_History:  Taylor's is now into its fourth century: one of the very oldest of Port companies. It is the last totally independent company of the original British Port houses - and is still family owned and managed. For more than 300 years Taylor's name has been synonymous with consistent excellence in Port. The stature of its Ports is acknowledged by experts everywhere - and by the international wine auctions which regularly price Taylor's vintage Port ten to fifteen per cent above its rivals.

P_RegionalInformation:  Vines have grown on the steep and rocky slopes of the Douro since Roman times. The soil is schist, a hard rock which often has to be broken up using dynamite when planting. Vines are one of the few plants to ssurvive here, and have to put roots down as much as 25 feet in order to find water. Summers can be hot, and winters very cold, but the Douro's unique and austere beauty means that it is now a World Heritage Site.

P_Region:  Marlborough 
P_RegionalInformation:  The fruit comes from select vineyards within the Marlborough sub-regions of the Wairau and Awatere Valleys. This Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc was personally blended by chat show host Graham Norton in collaboration with New Zealand’s Invivo Wines. Graham had previously blended a 2015 Sauvignon with Invivo that was a hit and sold out… The nation’s favourite host is back for more! The 2016 version was blended in his home county, County Cork, Ireland. Invivo co-founder, Tim Lightbourne and winemaker Rob Cameron travelled over 20,000 kilometres to Norton’s summer home with six distinctive Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc pressings. Invivo’s other Chief Winemaker, Rob Cameron, comments: “Graham has a highly tuned palate and makes a superb winemaker. We’ve been blown away by the demand for this wine and can’t wait to share our prized new vintage with the UK.”

P_History:  For almost two centuries, the Jaboulet family has shared a common passion for the Rhône Valley. This Côtes du Rhône takes its name from the 45th North parallel which runs two kilometres from the cellars of Maison Paul Jaboulet Aîné. In the village of Pont de l'Isère, a monument symbolises this line with the inscription: “the South begins here”. Our wine has had this name since the beginning of the 1950s.

P_RegionalInformation:  One of the specific features of Lacheteau lies in the important share of business devoted to marketing estate-bottled wines (5 to 6 million bottles per year). This policy is based on long-term work on two key points: - Monitoring the estates and the quality of the wines, - The conditions for bottling on the property, which must be safe and in line with the wines' organoleptic qualities. The Vineyard is located on the slopes of the Loire, between Angers and Saumur.

P_History:  In the late 1800s the Murray River was a thriving trade highway with commercial paddle steamers transporting wheat, wool and household supplies. One such paddle steamer met with an untimely end when a fire reduced it to ashes. Among the wreckage was a singed sign carrying the name of the boat ‘The City of Oxford'. Then on, the area was known as Oxford Landing. In 1958, winemaking visionary Wyndham Hill Smith sank a spade into the riverside dirt. He believed this fertile red soil and bountiful sunshine would be ideal for growing premium grape varieties, and Oxford Landing Estates was born.

P_History:  In many ways, Memŏro is an uncharted territory for us: it is the first time when Piccini takes up the challenge of creating a wine as an Italian icon. The challenge was to create a wine that would not only taste Italian beyond any doubt, but would feel Italian. The project is the fruit of a long research and experimentation, testing and blending from all Italy.

P_History:  Millions of years ago this land was covered by sea. As the sea resided, a bed of limestone was formed leaving in its place a landscape rich with shells, fish and even whale fossils. The nutrient rich, stony soils, layered over fossilised limestone, provides excellent drainage, balanced with perfect water retention. The vineyards have undoubtedly benefited from this fertile land.

P_TastingNotes:  A wine with so many awards to its name, it needs a cabinet. A classic blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, with the grapes coming from top-rated Premier and Grand Cru vineyards, this is a sophisticated Champagne with classic toasty aromas and fresh, crisp citrus and apple flavours. Serve chilled, on its own or with canapes like smoked salmon blinis, or go crazy and have it with fish & chips - a great match!

P_Region:  Hawkes Bay 
P_RegionalInformation:  The Hawke's Bay wine region is arguably the most exciting find for the cultivation of Merlot in New Zealand. Ancient alluvial river terraces provide for a superb mix of soils over gravelly, free-draining sub soils, with an abundance of pure river water for irrigation. With a temperate maritime climate, the vines are warmed by strong clear sunlight during the day and cooled at night by the sea breezes of the Pacific Ocean. This is the unique environment in which Merlot produces vibrant, fully ripened varietal flavours.

It was Paul Bouchard (1814-1898), the 5th generation of the family, who became the Grand Conseiller by founding the viticultural school in Beaune, to further develop and pass on growing techniques and wine making skills to future generations. This wine has been made as a celibration of Paul Bouchard's dedication to the region, his city and of course his wines.

P_TastingNotes:  This is a really lovely - and slightly unusual - blend of the Gros Manseng and Colombard grapes, selected from vineyards in Gascogny, France. It works brilliantly, with gorgeous lemon and grapefruit flavours; fantastically fresh too. Lovely pre-food drink or match with simple tomato salads or chicken dishes.

P_Region:  Marlborough 
P_RegionalInformation:  Another excellent growing season with dry conditions for most of the harvest. A warm November and December set up good flowering and fruit set. Cooler weather over late February through till the end of harvest slowed the season up, but this is seen as very positive in terms of retaining natural acidity in the wines and in building intensity of flavour. Although rain was experienced in late April, this had little effect on the vintage as most of the fruit had already been harvested.

Château Bouchassy sits within Lirac AOC, one of only two southern Rhône crus on the west bank of the Rhône, just across the river from the famous region of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Heated by the sun and the vineyard's stony soil yet tempered by low rainfall, the Grenache and Syrah grapes produce very full, deep-coloured wines with an undeniable intensity.

La Casita Reserva Sauvignon Blanc 2014, Chile, 13% Chile is gaining an enviable reputation for top-quality Sauvignon Blanc, and this is a glorious example from north of Santiago in the Elqui Valley-The altitude and cool mountain air currents result in a wine with fresh citrus scents and lots of zingy gooseberry flavours- Try pairing it with grilled white fish seasoned with dill and lemon. Elmstone Sauvignon Blanc 2016, South Africa, 12.5% A delicious crisp, dry wine with vibrant notes of tropical fruits and a long, zesty and refreshing finish.

P_Region:  California 
P_RegionalInformation:  The varietal thrives in warm climate and can be found in a number of California's wine growing regions, including Central Valley situated at the foot of Sierra Nevada Mountains. The sheltered environment created by the mountains favours a long growing season in the valley. Warm daytime temperatures often cool down at night, encouraging grapes to ripen slowly. Zinfandel accumulates deep and concentrated character on the vine when given a week or two of additional hang time.

P_History:  The Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée of Madiran is situated in the foothills of the Pyrenean mountains in the medieval village of Madiran. It is an ancient vineyard which was known for its wine as early as the 11th century. The golden age of Madiran was probably between the 16th and 18th centuries when Henry 4th served it to his most prestigious guests, be they French or foreign, in his chateau at Pau.

P_Region:  South West 
P_RegionalInformation:  Nestled in the foothills of the Pyrenees, the Madiran appellation is famous for the richness of its red wines while, from the perspective of the authentic vineyards below, the view over the mountain peaks (the cimes) is simply breath-taking. Relatively mild winters, hot and stormy summers and dry, sunny autumns are important factors in ensuring a good maturation in this region. Tannat, a local grape variety, is the star of Madiran giving them their character and originality.

P_History:  Early in the 20th century, the winemakers from Nantes had the habit of keeping the best barrel of the crop to celebrate the important family events. Preserved without racking, this "wedding barrel" gave the wine a particular character. They were more fresh in the mouth with a complete bouquet. It is these wines that resulted in Muscadet "Sur Lie" being born.

P_History:  In early 2003 the current owners of Spring Creek Vintners (The Neylon and Wiffin families) clearly identified the need for additional wine making services in Marlborough; it took another two years of resource consents and planning to finally get the project under-way. Their philosophy has always been to approach each situation from the winemaker's perspective - “All of our resources have gone into providing a state of the art winery that does make award winning wines for exceptional winegrowers."

P_History:  Port wine is produced in the Douro valley which was defined and established as a protected region in 1756, making it the oldest defined, regulated and protected wine region in the world. Port became popular in England during the 1700's after the Methuen Treaty was signed in 1703. Merchants were allowed to import Port wine at low duty rate while war with France deprived them of French wines.

P_Region:  Douro 
P_RegionalInformation:  The Port region has three areas. Baixo Corgo is the western most area and the wettest in terms of rainfall. Grapes from here are used for inexpensive Ruby and Tawny Ports. Further upstream is Cima Corgo centred on the town of Pinhao. This region is hotter and drier. Grapes grown here are used for Vintage and LBV Ports. Even further upstream is the Douro Superior the hottest of all three regions. Not widely cultivated due to the accessibility of the area. Port is produced here in small quantities.

P_History:  The story behind one of Chile's most famous wines began more than 120 years ago. Don Melchor, the founder of Concha y Toro, stored batches of his best wines in an underground cellar. When he noticed that bottles had been stolen, he spread a rumour amongst the locals that a devil lived in his cellar. Hence the name of Casillero del Diablo, the devil's cellar. Since 2008, Diablo wines have received more than 80 awards from internationally recognised competitions, including 8 Gold medals and 18 Silver medals

P_Region:  Umbria 
P_RegionalInformation:  The Orvieto zone is in the province of Terni in the south-western corner of Umbria. Long recognized as the perfect terrain for planting grapevines, the tufaceous soils (chalky limestone soil) and bedrock are characteristic of the area. This type of soil not only contributes to the quality of the local terroir but was also used to carve out wine cellars beneath the city for long-term storage.

The territory is largely mountainous, with an intricate network of hills and valleys and a predominantly limestone. Irpinia has a proud tradition of producing wines, cheeses, salami, chestnuts, hazelnuts and the black truffles.

P_Region:  Salta 
P_RegionalInformation:  Torrontés is taking center stage a few hundred miles to the northwest, in the Cafayate region of Salta. It is believed that Argentina's flagship white varietal was brought to the country by Spanish Jesuits in the 18th century. Torrontés is found in the world's highest vineyards, resting at 5,000 to 6,000 feet above sea level in Argentina. The high altitude growing conditions translate beautifully to bright floral aromas and delightfully crisp acidity in our Tesco Finest Torrontés wine.

P_TastingNotes:  Torrontes is the grape, here sourced from the high altitude Cafayate region in Argentina - The relatively cooler climate means the grapes ripen slowly, preserving fruit flavours - Which is good news, as they are lovely - lychees and rose petal aromas, together with tropical fruit flavours - A great one to match with lighter indian dishes.

P_TastingNotes:  From the slightly cooler Rioja Alta region in Spain, this is a beautifully crafted mature wine made soley from the Tempranillo grape by Baron de Ley. With sweet dark cherry fruit and a seductively soft oaky character, this is marvellously mellow. Sip fireside, or enjoy with slow roasted red meats.

P_History:  The story behind one of Chile's most famous wines began more than 120 years ago. Don Melchor, the founder of Concha y Toro, stored batches of his best wines in an underground cellar. When he noticed that bottles had been stolen, he spread a rumour amongst the locals that a devil lived in his cellar. Hence the name of Casillero del Diablo, the devil's cellar. Since 2008, Diablo wines have received more than 80 awards from internationally recognised competitions, including 8 Gold medals and 18 Silver medals

P_TastingNotes:  Casillero del Diablo Reserva Privada Sauvignon Blanc is the result of years of research and hard work, capturing the best of selected Chilean valleys. The secret of this exclusive creation lies in the process of working with grapes carefully chosen from specific zones offering a unique contribution to the wine. The colour is a bright, faint yellow, while the aroma teases subtle minerals on the nose and hints of distinctive Sauvignon Blanc citrus and herb nuances add to the freshness. On the palate, lime, grapefruit and peach aromas mark a crisp, elegant wine with rich, balanced acidity that has a long rewarding finish.

The current owner Martine Cazeneuve bought the Chateau in 1989 and began to tend the vines and winery back to its former magnificence.in 2003 the estates wines were awarded the much coverted title "Cru Bourgeois". The estate is situated next to the vineyards of Lagune and Cantermele.

In addition, new techniques of cluster thinning and harvest practices were implemented to further increase concentration. This research program also led to the conclusion that the poor soils near the Andes, were actually ideal for quality viticulture.

P_Region:  Mendoza 
P_RegionalInformation:  Mendoza is renowned for housing some of the best winegrowing regions of Argentina. The character of Mendoza wines is forged in high altitude desert vineyards irrigated by mineral-rich snowmelt from glaciers and snowfields. High altitude means cool temperatures and clear air, and clear air means more sunlight for building flavor in the grapes, helping to make Mendoza the source of Argentina's well-earned reputation for top quality, unique wines.

P_Region:  Rueda 
P_RegionalInformation:  Harvested Sept/Oct 2014. During this crop‘s growing cycle, we have had a rainy spring, a very hot summer, and a final maturation period consisting of low night time temperatures and high daytime temperatures, which have been very positive in obtaining a very high quality product. The vineyards are supervised year-round by the winery's technical department, tracking each vine individually and harvesting each plot at its most appropriate moment.

P_RegionalInformation:  Costieres de Nimes in the South of France has a Mediterranean climate which provides hot, dry summers and is famed for the Mistral, a very strong and cold north wind which helps to cool the vines and is beneficial to the development of healthy grapes. The soil is a mix of calcium and sandy loam, which provides excellent drainage and heat retention.

P_History:  The Denbies' farm traces its history back to the 18th Centruy. Denbies Wine Estate is family owned and run, one of the largest privately owned in Northern Europe. The current owners acquired the Estate in 1985. An eminent local geologist identified that the estate had exactly the same soil composition of the Champagne region in France and that the Dorking area had a history of wine making dating back to Roman times. This knowledge combined with the vision of the present owner resulted in the planting of 300,000 vines over 265 acres.

P_HeirarchyCode:  W47SL 
P_History:  As in many countries in Europe, a hundred years ago, Italian cider or ‘sidro’ was a drink commonly drunk by farmers and peasants. Sadly (for Italian cider fans…), under Benito Mussolini, the fermentation of all fruit except grapes was forbidden, so as to support the Italian wine industry. Italian cider then all but disappeared for several decades, but is now returning as a regional speciality in northern Italy, with a style all of its’ own. Angioletti is named after the founder's beloved daughters, his 'little angels' or 'Angioletti'.

P_TastingNotes:  Angioletti Rosé with Blueberry is a vibrant, fruity and refreshing sparkling craft Italian cider; it has aromas of ripe forest fruits are followed by fresh apple flavours balanced by the rounded, juicy character of blueberry fruit. The aftertaste is long, clean and fresh with a hint of creaminess. Angioletti Rosé with Blueberry is made in the same way as Prosecco, but using apples and a splash of blueberry instead of grapes, it’s sparkling style making it perfect for special occasions and ‘al fresco’ celebrations. Ideally serve chilled in a large flute glass, Rosé with Blueberry can be enjoyed on it’s own as an apéritif or alongside lighter dishes such as roast peach, basil and buffalo mozzarella salad.

P_History:  The history of one of the largest Sherry houses dates back to 1760 when King Carlos III of Spain appointed His Excellence Don Joaquin as the 'Marqués del Real Tesoro' after he led his fleet to victory against an onslaught of pirate ships. In 1898 the same title was bestowed upon the grandson of the first Marqués who founded a brand name after his title 'Marqués del Real Tesoro'. This prestigious name is now carried around the world and associated with some of the most select Sherry of Jerez.

P_History:  Barefoot Wine & Bubbly got started in California in the 1960s. Its founders believed that wine should be more fun and less serious; and created a wine that could be enjoyed by everyone from first-time wine drinkers to hard-core aficionados. Barefoot Wine & Bubbly is the most awarded and #1 wine brand in the US and was introduced to the UK in 2007. Staying true to its grassroots beginnings Barefoot Wine & Bubbly gives back to local non-profit groups through charitable wine donations.

P_History:  In winemaking terms, Coonawarra has a short but spectacular history. The first vintage was in the late 1800s after settlers realised that the soils and climate were perfect for growing both fruit trees and vines. The sublime quality of the wines from this region started to be recognised internationally as late as the 1980s and has been a consistent source for outstanding Australian wine ever since.

P_History:  The story behind one of Chile's most famous wines began more than 120 years ago. Don Melchor, founder of Concha y Toro, stored batches of his best wines in an underground cellar. When he noticed that bottles had been stolen, he spread a rumour amongst the locals that a devil lived in his cellar. Hence the name of Casillero del Diablo, the devil's cellar. Since 2008, Diablo wines have received more than 80 awards from internationally recognised competitions, including 8 Gold medals and 18 Silver medals.

P_Region:  Andalucia 
P_RegionalInformation:  Gonzalez Byass is situated in the city of Jerez, Andalusia, in the heart of the D.O. Jerez. This area enjoys a warm and humid climate which helps in the maturation of the grapes. The Gonzalez Byass vineyards are found on the albariza soil which is the best soil in the area for the growth of vines as it has a very high chalk content and therefore a large capacity for maintaining moisture, very important given the long, hot and dry summers experienced in Jerez.

P_RegionalInformation:  At the edges of the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on Earth, the Limarí Valley is at the outer limit of wine production in Chile. Despite the extreme conditions, it is a paradise for grape production. The Marques de Casa Concha Chardonnay is from a vineyard on the south bank of the Limarí River. Located close to the Pacific Ocean the weather is cool with a significant drop in temperature after sunset. The Marques Chardonnay delivers a spectacular result with intense flavours, crisp acidity and a fresh mineral quality.

P_History:  The origins of Cherubino Valsangiacomo date back to 1831, in Switzerland. That year, Vittore Valsangiacomo founded a winery under his name in Chiasso in the Swiss canton of Ticino next to the border with Italy. It was the first family winery. In 2002 the wineries were extended and modernized, and a new plant and bottling line were created. Today, the fifth generation of the Valsangiacomo family is in charge of the direct management of the winery, demonstrating our commitment to the future .

P_History:  The history of one of the largest Sherry houses dates back to 1760 when King Carlos III of Spain appointed His Excellence Don Joaquin as the 'Marqués des Real Tesoro' after leading his fleet to victory against an onslaught of pirate ships. In 1898 the same title was bestowed upon the grandson of the first Marqués who founded a brand name after his title 'Marqués del Real Tesoro'. This prestigious name is now carried around the world and associated with some of the most select Sherry of Jerez.

P_History:  Port wine is produced in the Douro valley which was defined and established as a protected region in 1756, making it the oldest defined, regulated and protected wine region in the world. Port became popular in England during the 1700's after the Methuen Treaty was signed in 1703. Merchants were allowed to import Port wine at low duty rate while war with France deprived them of French wines.

P_Region:  Douro 
P_RegionalInformation:  The Port region has three areas. Baixo Corgo is the western most area and the wettest in terms of rainfall. Grapes from here are used for inexpensive Ruby and Tawny Ports. Further upstream is Cima Corgo centred on the town of Pinhao. This region is hotter and drier. Grapes grown here are used for Vintage and LBV Ports. Even further upstream is the Douro Superior the hottest of all three regions. Not widely cultivated due to the accessibility of the area. Port is produced here in small quantities.

P_Region:  South Eastern Australia 
P_RegionalInformation:  The fruit was selected from vineyards mainly in the Murray Darling region. The climate is hot with high evaporation rates & generally low rainfall making irrigation essential. The climate is also continental, resulting in long sunny days and noticeably cooler nights. Modern viticultural & winemaking techniques mean that the climate can be seen as one of the region's strengths. Long sunshine hours ensure fruit ripens fully & low relative humidity results in little incidence of disease.

P_History:  Founded in 1993, Cono Sur's winery is based in Chimbarongo, in the heart of the Colchagua Valley. This is 93 miles South of Santiago in Chile. Cono Sur translates as ‘Southern Cone', which is a colloquial name for part of South America that falls below the Tropic of Capricorn due to the shape of the continent. The squiggle above ‘Cono Sur' in our logo emulates this. It is entirely a coincidence that the name sounds like ‘connoisseur'. Cono Sur is currently Chile's most awarded winery, winning over 15 Best In Class/International Trophies at the major wine competitions in the last three years. Cono Sur are Chile's most famous Pinot Noir producers, accounting for two thirds of all UK Chilean Pinot Noir sales Cono Sur have a reputation as innovators - first to produce Viognier and first to use screwcaps in Chile. But more than this they are recognized globally as a pioneer of environmentally-friendly winemaking.

P_Region:  California 
P_RegionalInformation:  Winemakers selected grapes from a valley at the foot of California's Sierra Nevada Mountain range. Approximately 100 km from San Francisco in the north, the Central Valley is a fertile region stretching over 500 km to the south. Merlot vineyards planted here benefit from ideal weather conditions. Warm daytime temperatures and cool nights average into a moderate growing climate, so the grapes mature gradually, developing concentrated character and deep fruit flavours.

In 2013, 15th generation (XV) Austrian winemaker Lenz M Moser V became involved with this historic winery, imparting 1,000 years of wine heritage and launching Chateau Changyu Moser XV.

P_RegionalInformation:  Ningxia lies approximately 1,330 kilometres west of Beijing, on the fringes of the Gobi desert and feeding off the Yellow River. The grapes have ideal growing conditions in the Helen Mountains Region at 1,100 metres above sea level. With the arid nature of the land and around 3,000 sunlight hours during the growing season (compared with Bordeaux's 2,052 hours average), the berries are allowed to fully ripen. The desert, with its cold nights, helps the wines to retain their freshness.

P_Region:  Mendoza 
P_RegionalInformation:  The Mendoza Province is one of Argentina's most important wine regions, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the country's entire wine production. Located in the eastern foothills of the Andes, in the shadow of Mount Aconcagua, vineyards are planted at the some of the highest altitudes in the world with the average site located 1,970-3,610 feet (600-1,100 meters) above sea level. The principal wine producing areas fall into two main departments-Maipú and Luján which includes Argentina's first delineated appellation established in 1993 in Luján de Cuyo. Situated in the upper Mendoza valley, where the river is half-way through its journey from the Andes mountains to the eastern plains, many Lujan de Cuyo vineyards sit at altitudes of around 1000m (3280ft). Malbec in particular is successful in Lujan de Cuyo, but the appellation also produces good Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Torrontes. The majority of the vineyards are on alluvial soils; sandy or stony surfaces on clay subtrata.

Tinto Historico is a revival, from a time long gone where Malbec and Petit Verdot was the norm.

P_Region:  California 
P_RegionalInformation:  Winemakers selected grapes from a valley at the foot of California's Sierra Nevada Mountain range. Approximately 100 km east of San Francisco, the Central Valley is a fertile region stretching over 500 km from north to the south. Chardonnay vineyards planted here benefit from almost ideal weather conditions. Warm daytime temperatures and cool night's average into a moderate growing climate, so the grapes mature gradually, developing concentrated character and deep fruit flavours.

P_TastingNotes:  A wine that is full of flavours of refreshingly crisp apple and luscious tropical fruit. With just a hint of vanilla, this is a modern take on a Californian classic which will leave you with a lingering citrus finish.

P_TastingNotes:  Back in 1850, Thomas Hardy (not the writing one) arrived in Australia from England, aged just 20, and a few years later established a winery in South Australia. Today, it is one of Australian wine's success stories and this wine shows just why Hardy's has won so many admirers. Rich and ripe, with black berry and cherry fruit flavours, spiced plums and vanilla too. Properly brilliant with sausages and mash.

P_History:  Founded in 1692, Taylor's is the only original British port house to have remained entirely family owned and run throughout its history. During this time the firm has pioneered many styles of port, including Late Bottled Vintage, dry white port and the commercialisation of single quinta port. Taylor's was the first port shipper to purchase property in the Douro in 1744 and now owns three grade 'A' estates, Quinta de Vargellas, Quinta de Terra Feita and Quinta do Junco.

P_Region:  Douro 
P_RegionalInformation:  The exteremes of climate, aspect and soil are all important influences in the production of port. The Marao mountain range protects the Douro valley from the Atlantic influence. The result is dramatically reduced rainfall and opposing extremes of temperature in summr and winter. 90% of the region is on a gradient steeper than 1 in 3. Traditional planting is on tiers of horizontal walled terraces. Modern plantings are on earth bank terraces or up and down the slopes.

P_History:  Chateau Camplazens was acquired in 2001 by an English couple, Sue and Peter Close. A boutique vineyard and a jewel on La Clape in the heart of Languedoc in Southern France, however, it was not the stunning natural beauty of this very special place which was the main attraction, it was the wine itself. The Close Family Mission is to develop the potential of Camplazens to produce wines which are truly World Class and which best express the savours and aromas of this very special microclimate.

The Rhône village of Laudun, was one of the first to be allowed to label its wine ‘Côtes du Rhône Villages' - an indication of its quality and provenance. Situated to the west of the Rhône river, the well-drained, sandy clay soils lend themselves to the cultivation of Rousanne and Marsanne grapes, which produce these elegant white wines.

Today the business is headed up by Pierre Henry Gagey, who was entrusted with the management of Louis Jadot in 1962 by Madame Jadot following the death of her son, Louis Auguste Jadot.

P_History:  Pagos del Rey occupies a privileged setting on the right bank of the Ebro river in the foothills of Rioja Alavesa in the town of Fuenmayor, where wine-making and tradition form the very heart of the Rioja Denominacion de Origen Califcada. Work on the Pagos del Rey winery in La Rioja began in 2004, with the first vintage in 2006 and completion of the buildings in 2008. The jewel in its crown is its ageing house, with room for 20,000 American and French oak barrels.
